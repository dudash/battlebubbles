=============

The Xbox 360 indie game "Battle Bubbles (Four Corners)"

I'm releasing Battle Bubbles as open source under the terms of the GNU GPLv3.  I'm hoping that the code will be useful to some new game developers.

I developed the code a few years ago and, at the time of this writing, the game is available on the xbox live arcade.

Here is the game's elevator pitch:
What happens when you mix a multiplayer strategy game with an arcade game, and then sprinkle cool bubble physics on top? Battle Bubbles. It's a 4-way battle royale for domination of the game board. Play on 10 built-in levels, or create your own! Battle Bubbles is the most fun when you play against your friends, but there is built-in artificial intelligence just in case you're all alone."

Project Dependencies:
* XNA Game Studio 3.1
* Berlin Sans FB Demi Font installed (or just don't use it)
* XBOX 360

Tools Used for Development:
* Paint DotNet
* Audacity

Other Project Contributers:
* Pete "Gonz" Gonzalez - extra AI development
* Lando, http://jelloknee.com/ - Kick ass tracks

Finally, if you would like to use the code for something outside the GPLv3 licensing restrictions, please contact me and ask permission first - chances are I'll say yes.
